Adds a Webmaster user role between Administrator and Editor. Perfect for clients and those who know just enough to be dangerous.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a new role named "Admin" that is the same as "Administrator" with the following changes:

In WP-Admin:
- Hide / Remove Settings menu
- Hide / Remove Plugins menu
- Hide / Remove Tools menu
- Disable theme installation
- Disable theme switching
- Hide / Remove Appearance > Editor
- Disable WP core updates
- Disable capability to add/delete/edit users

3rd party plugin compatibility:

- Gravity Forms (RocketGenius) - user can view form entries but not edit them or create new ones
- Ultimate Branding (WPMU Dev) - hide branding menu
- Sucuri Scanner (Sucuri) - hide security scan information
- Advanced Custom Fields (Elliot Condon) - hide ACF menu, only admins/developers should be modifying ACF definitions/rules/fields
